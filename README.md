# CB_Lab4Layer

This is the experimental CMSIS-Build Laboratory that uses project layers to compose multiple project examples from a set of different software packs.  

The overall goal is to generate multiple reference examples for many different evaluation kits that demonstrate the functionality of complex software stacks.  The range of examples is not limited, it can start from a simple RTOS based Blinky to more complex examples such as Cloud IoT connectors, or Machine Learning examples.

## Directory Structure

Directory  | Content Description
:----------|:----------------
/build     | Input: Scripts that generate referernce examples from layers
/layers    | Input: Software layers that are extracted from projects
/project   | Output: Software examples that are generated by build scripts

Note: this is work in progress and there are several gaps that we will close in the near future:

Output Projects are currently manually configured for MDK (uVision).  In future, the Board pack should define the configuration of example projects as the board may have on-board debug adapters.

Watson MQTT Demo for 32F746GDISCOVERY board with WiFi Module

This demo application connects to Watson IoT through MQTT
and publishes messages.

It requires a registered device in the Watson IoT Platform (IBM Cloud console).

1. Configure Watson IoT connection settings in helloWorld.c:
 - ORG_ID:      Organization ID
 - DEVICE_TYPE: Device Type
 - DEVICE_ID:   Device ID
 - TOKEN:       Authentication Token

2. Provide Server Certificate: IoTFoundation.pem on File System Drive M0:

3. Select target:
 - STM32F746G-D ESP8266:  ESP8266 WiFi Module
 - STM32F746G-D WizFi360: WizFi360 WiFi Module

4. Build the application

5. Connect the on board ST-Link Debugger via USB

6. Run the application and observe the messages in the Debug (printf) window

AWS MQTT Demo
=============

This demo application connects to [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/) 
through MQTT, subscribes to topics and publishes messages.

It requires an active and properly configured [thing](https://www2.keil.com/iot/aws).

You can use the AWS IoT MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to watch the 
MQTT messages sent and received by AWS IoT.

The following describes the various components and the configuration settings.

Once the application is configured you can:
 - Build the application
 - Connect the debugger
 - Run the application and view messages in a debug printf or terminal window


AWS IoT Client
--------------
The file `iot_config.h` configures the connection to AWS IoT with these settings:
 - IOT_DEMO_SERVER:      Remote Host
 - IOT_DEMO_ROOT_CA:     Trusted Server Root Certificate
 - IOT_DEMO_CLIENT_CERT: Client Certificate
 - IOT_DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY: Client Private Key
 - IOT_DEMO_IDENTIFIER:  Thing Identifier

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!


RTX5 Real-Time Operating System
-------------------------------
The [RTX5 RTOS](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/RTOS2/html/rtx5_impl.html) 
implements the resource management. It is configured with the following settings:

- Global Dynamic Memory size: 24000 bytes
- Default Thread Stack size: 3072 bytes


WiFi IoT Socket
---------------
This implementation uses an IoT socket layer that connects to a 
[CMSIS-Driver WiFi](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Driver/html/index.html).

The file `socket_startup.c` configures the WiFi connection with these settings:
 - SSID:          network identifier
 - PASSWORD:      network password
 - SECURITY_TYPE: network security

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!


WiFi Module
-----------
This project contains targets for different WiFi shields. Select the right target for your hardware:
 - LPCXpresso55S69 ESP8266:  [ESP8266 WiFi Module](https://www2.keil.com/iot/shields/wrl13287)
 - LPCXpresso55S69 WizFi360: [WizFi360 WiFi Module](https://www2.keil.com/iot/shields/wizfi360)

The module is connected via an Arduino connector using a USART or SPI interface.
It exposes a **CMSIS-Driver WiFi**.


NXP LPCXpresso55S69 Target Board
--------------------------------
The Board layer contains the following configured interface drivers:

**CMSIS-Driver USART2** routed to Arduino UNO R3 connector (P18):
 - RX: D0 PLU_OUT6/GPIO/FC2_USART_RXD_ARD
 - TX: D1 FC2_USART_TXD_ARD

**STDOUT** routed to Virtual COM port (DAP-Link, baudrate = 115200)

The board configuration can be modified using [MCUxpresso](https://www.keil.com/nxp)
and is stored in the file `LPCXpresso55S69.mex`.

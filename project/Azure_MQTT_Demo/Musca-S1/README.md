Azure MQTT Demo
===============

This demo application connects to 
[Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/) 
through MQTT, sends messages and checks for receive confirmation.

It requires a registered [device](https://www2.keil.com/iot/microsoft) in the Azure IoT hub.

The following describes the various components and the configuration settings.

Once the application is configured you can:
 - Build the application
 - Connect the debugger
 - Run the application and view messages in a debug printf or terminal window


Azure IoT Client
----------------
The file `iothub_ll_telemetry_sample_mdk.c` configures the connection to 
Azure IoT Hub with these settings:
 - connectionString: Connection string - primary key

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!


RTX5 Real-Time Operating System
-------------------------------
The [RTX5 RTOS](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/RTOS2/html/rtx5_impl.html) 
implements the resource management. It is configured with the following settings:

- Global Dynamic Memory size: 24000 bytes
- Default Thread Stack size: 3072 bytes


WiFi IoT Socket
---------------
This implementation uses an IoT socket layer that connects to a 
[CMSIS-Driver WiFi](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Driver/html/index.html).

The file `socket_startup.c` configures the WiFi connection with these settings:
 - SSID:          network identifier
 - PASSWORD:      network password
 - SECURITY_TYPE: network security

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!


WiFi Module
-----------
This project contains targets for different WiFi shields. Select the right target for your hardware:
 - Musca-S1 ESP8266:  [ESP8266 WiFi Module](https://www2.keil.com/iot/shields/wrl13287)
 - Musca-S1 WizFi360: [WizFi360 WiFi Module](https://www2.keil.com/iot/shields/wizfi360)

The module is connected via an Arduino connector using a USART or SPI interface.
It exposes a **CMSIS-Driver WiFi**.


Arm Musca-S1 Target Board
-------------------------
The Board layer contains the following configured interface drivers:

**CMSIS-Driver USART1** routed to Virtual COM port (DAPLink):
 - RX: UART1_RX
 - TX: UART1_TX

**CMSIS-Driver USART0** routed to Arduino UNO R3 connector (J15):
 - RX: D0 GPIO0 (PA0)
 - TX: D1 GPIO1 (PA7)

**STDOUT** routed to Virtual COM port (DAPLink, baudrate = 115200)

Azure MQTT Demo
===============

This demo application connects to 
[Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/) 
through MQTT, sends messages and checks for receive confirmation.

It requires a registered [device](https://www2.keil.com/iot/microsoft) in the Azure IoT hub.

The following describes the various components and the configuration settings.

Once the application is configured you can:
 - Build the application
 - Connect the debugger
 - Run the application and view messages in a debug printf or terminal window


Azure IoT Client
----------------
The file `iothub_ll_telemetry_sample_mdk.c` configures the connection to 
Azure IoT Hub with these settings:
 - connectionString: Connection string - primary key

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!

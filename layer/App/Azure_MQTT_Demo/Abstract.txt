Azure MQTT Demo

This demo application connects to Azure IoT Hub through MQTT,
sends messages and checks for receive confirmation.

It requires a registered device in the IoT hub (Azure portal).

1. Configure IoT Hub connection string in iothub_ll_telemetry_sample_mdk.c:
 - connectionString: Connection string - primary key

2. Configure WiFi connection settings in socket_startup.c (when WiFi is used):
 - SSID:          network identifier
 - PASSWORD:      network password
 - SECURITY_TYPE: network security

3. Build the application

4. Connect the debugger

5. Run the application and observe the messages in the Debug (printf) window
   or external Terminal

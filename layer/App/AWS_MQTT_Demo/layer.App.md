AWS MQTT Demo
=============

This demo application connects to [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/) 
through MQTT, subscribes to topics and publishes messages.

It requires an active and properly configured [thing](https://www2.keil.com/iot/aws).

You can use the AWS IoT MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to watch the 
MQTT messages sent and received by AWS IoT.

The following describes the various components and the configuration settings.

Once the application is configured you can:
 - Build the application
 - Connect the debugger
 - Run the application and view messages in a debug printf or terminal window


AWS IoT Client
--------------
The file `iot_config.h` configures the connection to AWS IoT with these settings:
 - IOT_DEMO_SERVER:      Remote Host
 - IOT_DEMO_ROOT_CA:     Trusted Server Root Certificate
 - IOT_DEMO_CLIENT_CERT: Client Certificate
 - IOT_DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY: Client Private Key
 - IOT_DEMO_IDENTIFIER:  Thing Identifier

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!
